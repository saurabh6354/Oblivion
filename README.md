# Oblivion

Our app consists of three games :
1. Memory game: The game that consists of a 5Ã—5 grid of buttons that changes color. The color of each button can be turned to 1 or can be turned to 0 by pressing it. If a button is pressed, though, it changes the status of the four buttons adjacent to it as well. If the button is pressed and a neighboring button is 0, that neighbor will be turned to 1, and if the neighbor is 1 it will be turned to 0. The goal of the game is to turn 1 all of the colors in the grid.
2. Random Animations: The objective of this one is to generate an animation from its library which creates a sense of satisfaction in the user's mind. Here also we tried to give something to the user by introducing them to the concept of fractals. Fractals a curve or geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole.
3. Physics Visualize: The objective of this game is to make the students visualize the concept of motion, (a part of physics) where a user can change the velocity and acceleration and the ball will move accordingly. As humans, We perceive things better when we have something to visualize, So keeping that in mind we created a simple animator game to show how the concept of motion works.
